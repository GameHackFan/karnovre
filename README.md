# Karnov's Revenge Revolution
A mod for Karnov's Revenge (Neogeo).
<br/>
This mod brings some extra features, new moves, some changes / balance and fixes some bugs present in the original game.
<br/><br/>
You can access the patcher [here](https://gamehackfan.github.io/karnovre/).
<br/><br/>

For details about all changes this mod brings, see the changelog [here](https://github.com/GameHackFan/karnovre/blob/main/changelog).
<br/><br/>

Known Bugs:
- Sometimes when both players throw fireballs, the game draws bugged sprites for a few frames (bug present in the original game).
- Jean and Zazie tapping move sometimes bugs and grabs the wrong data, causing a lot of damage (bug present in the original game).
- Marstorius name is wrong in some places (bug present in the original game).
- There are switching side differences between P1 and P2.
<br/><br/>


WHAT'S NEXT: Well, this is the first version of this hack, it might still be very unbalanced, so maybe newer versions improving things might be needed.


A special thanks for the FHD community for their balance ideas.
